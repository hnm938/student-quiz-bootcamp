# Bootcamp Quiz

The assigment this week was the create a quiz for some of the things
we've learned during the course.

I created a simple quiz with a timer and a score. I created a leaderboard
instead of a highscore, being able to see all your previous scores and your highest score.

When a question answer is incorrect time and points are lost, when time is out or points are gone
the game ends.

For this project I decided to use SCSS for it's nesting power instead of regular CSS,
SCSS is compiled into CSS, just makes it easier to read and manage.
